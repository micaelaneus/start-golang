## 1. Install Golang on your machine

### Linux
Use your standard package manager to install Golang:
* Ubunto : `$ apt-get install golang`
* Debian : `$ dpkg install golang`
* Fedora/CentOS/RHEL : `$ yum install golang`

Refer to documentation for your installation if you run into trouble here. 

### Mac
Homebrew makes installing Golang very easy:
`$ brew install go`

If you don't use Homebrew, follow this link to [Golang's official download page](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the current package installer version for OSX.  

### Windows
Unfortunately, Windows remains fairly uncooperative when it comes to supporting package managers. Your best bet is to visit [Golang's official download page](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the Windows version.
